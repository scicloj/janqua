# Resolve project root.
#   1. JANQUA_PROJECT_ROOT env var — set by the Lua filter when it auto-starts
#      this script, so the script doesn't have to re-derive what Quarto
#      already told the filter (`quarto.project.directory`).
#   2. Walk up from the caller's cwd looking for an existing `.jank-pid` —
#      this is where a previous session anchored, so manual `stop`/`status`
#      finds the right session even from a subdirectory.
#   3. Fall back to cwd.
#
# We deliberately do NOT walk up from this script's own directory: under a
# Quarto extension symlink the script's own ancestry differs from the user's
# cwd, which used to cause PID/port mismatches.
#
# Filenames (.jank-pid, .jank-nrepl-port, .jank-repl.log) are private to
# Janqua, so the anchor only governs where OUR files live — we never touch
# user-authored files. The PROJECT_ROOT='/' check below is defensive against
# bugs that resolve to a pathological value.
